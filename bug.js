This React Native code uses AsyncStorage to store user data. However, it doesn't handle potential errors during the asynchronous operations. If there's an issue with AsyncStorage (e.g., device storage is full), the app might crash or exhibit unexpected behavior.  The code lacks error handling and proper cleanup.
